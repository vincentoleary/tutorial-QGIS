#QGIS documentation

Reference for installation and initial setup of QGIS for analysis of biodiversity. This documentation was created as part of my co-op at the Academy of Natural Sciences and is intended to be a guide for installing QGIS for the first time.

Installation 

> The most recent version of QGIS can be obtained from the QGIS website here: http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html. Once you have selected the correct OS and version it will ask to download. This normally takes 5 - 10 minutes to complete. If using a Windows computer, simply click the file after the download is finished and follow the prompts to install. You may need administrator priviledges to complete this step.

> When the installation is finished, you can open QGIS Desktop and begin to use the software immediately. For troubleshooting and reference, the most up to date documentation can always be found online here: http://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html. 

> If this is the first time you have used GIS software or are unfamiliar with the program, a beginner's guide to GIS is produced by the QGIS project and found online here: http://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/. A more detailed training manual from QGUS is also included in this repository for quick reference.

> Once you are comfortable with the basics, the QGIS user guide can be found online here: http://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/index.html. This is also available as a pdf version in this repository for quick reference.
